# SVM-with-hand-designed-feature
![introduction](https://github.com/liubai01/SVM-with-hand-designed-feature/blob/master/img/f1.bmp)

A case study of SVM with hand-designed feature in Chinese. English version is on schedule and will be released soon. This tutorial will help you get into the process of feature design in a classical machine learning process

### Prerequisite

1. Python3
2. Scikit-Learn
3. Numpy
4. Basic Knowledge of SVM(support vector machine)
5. Jupyter Notebook

### Study Goal

1. get a basic command of the usage of numpy
2. learn how to train a SVM classifier base on sklearn
3. have fun!
